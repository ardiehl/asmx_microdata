# asmx_microdata
This is an old fork of asmx that adds support for the microdata 1600/BasicFour 1200 assember.
It is based on the information found at

[69-2-0810-002_AP810_Assembly_Pgm_Jan70](http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/microdata/800/69-2-0810-002_AP810_Assembly_Pgm_Jan70.pdf)

I hope to be able to add support for the BasicFour 13xx boards as well. However, i only found some basic information about the opcodes i scanned here

[S-HDBK-211_Sorbus_SR_Handbook_for_Basic_Four_1981](http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/basicFour/S-HDBK-211_Sorbus_SR_Handbook_for_Basic_Four_1981.pdf)

I hope that at one point on time i will be able to find at least the following manuals
`1300 CPU Technical Manual`
` M1300 Series CPU Organisation and Description Reference Manual`

## Compile
It should compile on any linux system using make
There are some tests/samples in the folder testmd
